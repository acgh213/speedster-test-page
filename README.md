# Speedster Test Page

A wrapper around the [SpeedOfMe] JavaScript API for [Speedster].

## Setup

In order to use your own API key with Speedster, you need to host this respository on your own domain or subdomain.
To do so you can either:

- Fork this repository on Github and use `USERNAME.github.io/speedster-test-page` as your SpeedOfMe domain in Speedster (*See screenshot below*).
- Deploy this repository on your server and use your own domain in SpeedOfMe and Speedster. **Your server needs to support TLS**.

Here's how the Speedster settings would look like if you host this on github by forking it:
